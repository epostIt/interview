//Write a function called transpose that takes a 2D array of numbers and returns a new 2D array that is the transpose of the input array.
//The transpose of a matrix is a new matrix that has the rows and columns of the original matrix swapped.
//For example, if the input array is[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], the output array should be[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]].
